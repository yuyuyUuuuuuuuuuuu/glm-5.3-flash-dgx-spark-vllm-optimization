"""Keep hybrid prefix-cache hits when the DFlash2 group would zero them.

Issue #7: OpenClaw follow-ups looked like 0% APC. On this kit the MLA +
mamba groups already hit at the 3584-token hybrid align (README 3584/7760).
Two coordinator bugs then throw the extra block away:

1. ``dflash`` is ``use_eagle()``. GLM never sets ``is_eagle_group`` (that
   annotator is DeepseekV4-only), so HybridKVCacheCoordinator flags EVERY
   group. MLA drops its last scheduler-aligned block (~3584 tokens).
2. The DFlash2 SlidingWindow group still participates in the hybrid min.
   After an EAGLE one-block pop it re-aligns down by a full 3584-token
   scheduler page (block=64, align=3584), which can wipe a longer MLA hit.

KpoolTail already opts out of prefix caching (1-block circular scratch).
Mamba align-mode state *does* materialize at 896-token chunk ends, and
3584 is a multiple of 896, so mamba must stay in the min — skipping a
mamba miss is a correctness hole (vLLM #47491 / #43090).

This patch: flag only exact SlidingWindowSpec groups as EAGLE, and do not
let that drafter group shrink ``curr_hit_length``. If the drafter window
does not cover the MLA/mamba hit, leave its blocks empty so a fresh
window is allocated (zeros / new pages).

KpoolTail is deliberately per-request scratch and cannot prefix-cache. A
resumed request therefore starts with an empty indexer-tail ring. Replaying
fewer than one complete kpool leaves the ring incomplete and changes sparse
attention selection. Clamp the shared hit back to an earlier scheduler
boundary when necessary so at least one complete kpool is rebuilt before
decode. This preserves the older MLA/Mamba prefix hit while making the
non-shareable target state deterministic.

``GLM53_DRAFT_KV_COMPACT=1`` adds a DFlash-specific boundary lookup. The
EAGLE hit rule needs one complete, cached block AFTER the reconciled
boundary (then pops it) because an EAGLE draft KV at position p embeds
token p+1. DFlash context KV at position p is a per-position projection of
the target hidden state at p (``precompute_and_store_context_kv``: row-wise
RMSNorm, fused KV GEMM, K-norm, RoPE at p), so no such block exists in its
dataflow, and with a compact draft block B it cannot exist for any prompt
whose tail past the boundary is shorter than B. The drafter group is then
looked up ending exactly at the boundary (``drop_eagle_block=False``), and
its manager is kept non-EAGLE so the lookahead block is neither hashed
(``cache_blocks``) nor reserved by ``reachable_block_mask``: the retained
tail is exactly the ``cdiv(window - 1, B)`` blocks the lookup consults, one
pool block id fewer per window than the EAGLE form. The complete-window
check, replay clamp and EAGLE flag are unchanged. Default ``0`` keeps the
EAGLE lookahead lookup and retention.

Kpool replay floor (``[glm53-kpool-replay-floor-v1]``, text-identical to the
stage of upstream 770b9c9): the reused-boundary branch above breaks out
before the replay clamp, so with the boundary lookup a short tail can leave
1-3 fresh tokens -- fewer than one KpoolTail block -- and the request would
decode with an incomplete indexer-tail ring. The hit candidate is therefore
bounded by ``max_cache_hit_length + 1 - kpool_block`` (the KpoolTail block of
the non-participating scratch group), independently of retained drafter
windows. The replay clamp and EAGLE lookahead still use the true limit.
Inert when every candidate already leaves >= kpool fresh tokens (the
EAGLE lookahead form always leaves >= one draft block).

Installation states: pristine source; the legacy hybrid-apc form shipped in
the stock image (with or without the replay stage), which is migrated to the
v3 verification form first; already-current source, a byte-identical no-op.
Before writing, every owned stage must be present exactly once in its
supported form; a stage marker alone never counts as an installation.
Fail closed if the vLLM coordinator anchors drift.
