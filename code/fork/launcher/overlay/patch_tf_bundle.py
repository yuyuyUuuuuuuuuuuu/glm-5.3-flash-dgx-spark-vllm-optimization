"""[glm53-tf-bundle] Install the tf-exl3-fork bundle inside the serving container (idempotent, fail closed).

1. Copy /opt/glm53/tf/site/* into site-packages: the fork modules, its AOT extension (sm_121a) and the dist-info that
   registers the vllm.general_plugins entry point. The fork stays INERT unless TF_EXL3_MOE is 1/on/true/yes
   (integrate.install reads it when vLLM loads general plugins, in every process).
2. Run an overlay patch from /opt/glm53/tf/overlay/ ONLY when its env var is explicitly non-empty:
     patch_spec_resample_noise.py   GLM53_SPEC_RESAMPLE_INDEPENDENT (0|1)
     patch_spec_block_keys.py       GLM53_REJECTION_METHOD (standard|block): block -> row-keyed randomness of the DFlash2

                                    the resample-noise patch above, runs after it); standard -> prints and touches

                                    integrate.py: production's FA2 sparse-MLA plan uses the exact selected-key counts
                                    (2044 + ctx % 4 once ctx >= index_topk, not index_topk + ctx % 4), so decode rows

     patch_mhc_sp.py                GLM53_MHC_SP (0|1) — sequence-parallel prefill for the mHC bookkeeping over
                                    TP (docs/MHC_SP.md): a >= 1024-token forward keeps the residual stream SHARDED
                                    across the TP group (the per-token mHC family runs on T/2 rows; the

     patch_moe_fused16.py           GLM53_MOE_FUSED16 (0|1) — the P16 routed-MoE prefill (production arithmetic, faster

     patch_moe_e4m3.py              GLM53_MOE_E4M3 (0|1) — the e4m3 routed-MoE prefill: copies glm53_moe_e4m3.py + its

     patch_mhc_sp2.py               GLM53_MHC_SP2 (0|1) — needs GLM53_MHC_SP=1 (refuses otherwise): pipelined SP prefill
                                    (k=2 interleaved sub-chunks per rank shard, the reduce-scatter / all-gather of

                                    production's, the 24 mixing logits in the decode branch's fp32 arithmetic.
     patch_kpool_tail_positions.py  GLM53_KPOOL_TAIL_POSITIONS (0|1|2) — 2 = graph-safe (use 2; 1 is not read by FULL decode graphs): prepare_attn passes the
                                    token positions, so KpoolTailMetadataBuilder emits per-request circular tail slots
                                    (stock: every tail write past the first ring goes to block 0 / stale block ids and
                                    overwrites other requests' pooled indexer keys). docs/PREFIX_HIT_TAIL.md
     patch_mamba_align_seed.py      GLM53_MAMBA_ALIGN_SEED (0|1) — MambaHybridModelState.add_request seeds a prefix-hit /
                                    resumed request's running KDA column in mamba blocks (cache_config.mamba_block_size)
                                    instead of cache_config.block_size (576 once the engine core recomputes it; an
                                    in-process worker then pre-copies a zero/foreign state). docs/PREFIX_HIT_TAIL.md
   Empty/unset -> skipped, the image stays stock for that feature.
Any failure raises SystemExit, which stops the container start (same contract as the launcher's other patches).
